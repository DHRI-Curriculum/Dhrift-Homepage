The DHRIFT team is excited to announce that the project has received a National Endowment for the Humanities Level III Advancement Grant. This grant support will enable the team to continue to build a community of digital humanities teachers and learners, develop the DHRIFT platform, and create and maintain the DHRIFT curriculum.

The DHRIFT team is thrilled to stand alongside other critical projects in the digital humanities and library and museum spaces during the 2023-2025 grant period. Keep an eye on this space for updates as the DHRIFT team builds community, curriculum, and infrastructure for teaching technical methods in the humanities.
