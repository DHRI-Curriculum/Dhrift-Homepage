**DHRIFT** (Digital Humanities Resource Infrastructure for Teaching Technology) is an open educational resource (OER) and publication platform for teaching digital skills. Designed by humanities scholars for humanities scholars, DHRIFT includes a core set of reviewed and tested curricula on common digital humanities (DH) topics, enables the ready creation of websites to support workshops, institutes, and intensives, and provides a minimal computing, accessibility-aware, and interactive functionalities.DHRIFT's core curricula benefits from extensive classroom testing and has been used as the basis for workshops and classes at more than 20 colleges and universities across the United States.

If you are new to DH, start learning instantly by using DHRIFT's sample Digital Humanities Research Institute curricula to learn foundational concepts in DH computing. Or, if you are someone who already teaches DH workshops, consider building your own workshop using DHRIFT using our style guide (Forthcoming). Perhaps you are interested in hosting your own institute. Fork our GitHub repository and follow our tutorial to build your own stand-alone, static DHRIFT site using GitHub pages. You can select workshops from our directory to include in your site, design your own, and customize the site with your workshop's details.

## DHRIFT's features

The following features make DHRIFT unique:

- Core workshops include interactive code editors in the browser, which avoids complicated installations and allows students access to resources on phones, tablets, and ChromeBooks. It also circumvents security locks on computers that prevent downloading and installing software without IT approval.
- Our workshops meet standards that are based in humanities values. Every workshop includes: prerequisites, preparatory reading suggestions, ethical considerations, sample DH projects that use concepts introduced in the workshop, suggestions for further reading, and a theory-to-practice section to help students figure out their next steps.
- Sites are minimalist and our team is committed to improving download time, reducing dependency on stable access to wireless internet and increasing access for students whose internet is unreliable.
- DHRIFT-generated sites are static pages, which can be hosted for free through GitHub pages, reducing costs and increasing stability.
- A director of existing, tested workshops that cover a wide variety of DH topics in the digital humanities, reducing the time, resources, and redundany of having to build new workshops every time you teach.
- DHRIFT's workshops are Creative Commons licensed, and the code for the site generator is open source. We invite contributions, pull requests, and ideation.
- In addition to providing DHRIFT infrastructure, the DHRIFT team supports those teaching in the digital humanities through community events and outreach.
