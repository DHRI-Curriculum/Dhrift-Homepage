Patrick Smyth, (PhD), consultant, is Chief Learner at Iota School, an organization that provides accessible technical training for humanists. Patrick is a blind hacker and programmer who codes in Python, Lisp, and for the web, and his apps and other technical work have received attention in national publications such as PC Magazine and Phi Beta Kappa. From 2019 to 2021, Patrick coordinated Foundations for Research Computing, a cross-campus program that taught research computing skills to over 3,200 researchers at Columbia University. Patrick was a 2010 Fulbright Teaching Fellow in Berlin and is a Software Carpentry certified instructor. His work on DHRIFT will focus on accessibility testing in the web interface, API development, and the contribution and integration of curriculum. Patrickâ€™s professional work and research focuses on infrastructure as a form of values instantiated, and he believes that DHRIFT will help to build community around technical teaching in the humanities.
