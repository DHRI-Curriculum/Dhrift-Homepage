DHRIFT grows out of NEH-supported community work that has helped over 45 digital humanities practitioners in leading more than 30 local institutes. DHRIFT continues to work with this growing national community by providing online spaces, highlighting successful workshops and institutes, and sharing community news and materials. The development of DHRIFT OERs and platform is also guided by a community steering committee that meets regularly.
