<li>
Visit the <a href="https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/DHRIFT" target="_blank">DHRIFT Core GitHub repository</a>.
</li>

<li>
Fork the repository, which creates a copy of the repository on your own GitHub account. The `Fork` button is on the top right of the page.

</li>
<li>
You will be taken to a page that allows you to confirm the fork. Select your own GitHub account or the GitHub account of your organization and confirm.
</li>

<li>
Once your fork is successful, you will be taken to the page for the forked repository. On this page, select the `Settings` button on the menu bar at the top of the repository. The button is sometimes hidden behind an ellipsis (`...` or three dots) button.

Select the `Pages` option from the left navbar within the `Settings` menu.

You will see your deployment in progress in the center window. This process may take some time, between one and five minutes.
</li>

<li>
When the deployment is complete, you will see the icon to the left of the build message turn into a blue checkmark.
</li>

<li>
To view the deployed site, go to the `Settings` tab again. Under `Pages` on the left navbar, look for the message indicating that your site is live and follow the provided link.
